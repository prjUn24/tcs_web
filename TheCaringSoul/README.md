## Project Overview
Welcome to the **CaringSouls** project! This web application is built using **React** and **Vite**, offering a fast and efficient development environment. The project is structured to facilitate easy navigation and management of components and pages.

## Technical Aspects
- **Framework**: The project utilizes **React** with **Vite**, which enhances the development speed compared to traditional React frameworks. Vite's features include:
